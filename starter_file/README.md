# Predicting Heart Failures

This project aims to predict heart failures based on 12 features of patient information data. Both Automated ML and Hyperparamter tuning are applied and the best performing model of both is deployed.


## Project Set Up and Installation
Download the dataset below and upload it into the Datasets tab in your workspace in Microsoft Azure. 

## Dataset

### Overview
The dataset used is from Kaggle regarding heart failures with 12 features to predict whether an event of death occurs or not. The 12 features are as follows:
- Age
- Anaemia
- Creatinine
- Diabetes
- Injection fraction
- High blood pressure
- Platelets
- Serum Creatinine
- Serum Sodium
- Sex
- Smoking
- Time

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
